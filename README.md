# Prediction Linear Regression
 Here I made my prediction projects using linear regression model
 1. I made Black Bear coffee prediction model with a very minimal accuracy due to lack of real data
 2. I got real data of people who got insurance (source:kaggle.com). Final model accuracy is 75% which is average and can be improved by using more data or using more efficient model. Basically we can play with numbers and ** find an approximate bill of a person by giving that person's 6 parameters **
